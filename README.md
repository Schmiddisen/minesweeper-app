# Yet another minesweeper app

This is the project repository of our app in the mobile app development course.

## Features
- Minesweeper game
- Switch between three different difficulties (easy, medium, hard)
- zoom in and out of the tiles
- chording support
- see top daily runs
- five different skins that adapt to your local weather (defaults to Frankfurt a. M. if no location permissions is given)

## Tech Stack
- react expo
- weather.com API

We chose react expo simply because it was the main language in the course and we did not work with that yet.

Have fun!
